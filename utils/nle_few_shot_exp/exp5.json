    "Overall NL explanation": "This SPARQL query checks if all of Batman's partners speak English as their native language. It does this by identifying all of Batman's partners and checking their native languages. If any partner does not have English as their native language, the query will return false. The query uses an ASK query type, which returns a boolean value (true or false) indicating whether the specified conditions are met.",
