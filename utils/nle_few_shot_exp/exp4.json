    "Overall NL explanation": "This SPARQL query calculates the number of distinct individuals who have won either the Nobel Prize in Literature or the Nobel Prize in Physics since the year 2000. It does this by identifying people who have received these awards and filtering the results to include only those awarded after the year 2000. The query then counts the distinct individuals who meet these criteria.",
